Story

Meet Jack the Consultant. He is hard working but usually he is a little bit late in the office.
Of course all desks are occupied. He always spends a lot of time finding a desk and wastes his precious time.
That puts him in a bad mood. He never knows where is team members are located and only interacts with them over chat.

Success Story

It is monday morning. Jack was stuck in a traffic jam and is running late again. Also he spilled his coffee. In the elevator he checks the SmartOffice
App for an available desk. He finds a desk in proximity to his team. On the map he can easily find the desk. The app is registering Jack on the map.

Jill, who also uses the SmartOffice App, notices that Jack has entered the office. She hasn't talked to Jack personally in a while. Using SmartOffice she can
quickly locate Jack and invites him for a cup of coffee. What a great morning! :)
